                    How Does Computer-Assisted Telephonic Interview (CATI) Work?
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    CATI strategy allows interviewers to quickly and accurately record data while talking to respondents over the
                    phone. This type of survey collects quantitative data, which can be analyzed and used to better understand
                    customer needs, preferences, and behaviors. CATI surveys are typically structured to ensure that questions are
                    asked in the same order for each respondent and that responses can be accurately recorded. <br/>
                    Computer-assisted telephone interviewing or CATI is a method of conducting surveys over the phone using a
                    computer
                    program to guide the conversation and record the responses. <br/>
          
                    The interviewer uses the computer program to ask the questions and enter the respondent's answers, which are
                    then
                    stored in a database for analysis. <br/>
          
                    CATI allows for more efficient and accurate data collection than traditional telephone surveys, as it
                    eliminates
                    the need for the interviewer to manually record the answers and reduces the potential for errors. <br/>
