          <p>
            "Phone to Web" typically refers to a method of data collection or interaction where information is
            initially collected or transmitted through a phone call (typically a Computer-Assisted Telephone
            Interview, or CATI) and then transferred or connected to web-based platforms or databases for further
            analysis, storage, or reporting.

          </p>

          <p>
            This approach is often used in market research or survey administration.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, in a market research context, respondents may be contacted via telephone (CATI) to
            participate in a survey.
          </p>
          <p>
            The responses they provide during the phone interview are then entered into a web-based system for data
            analysis and reporting.
          </p>
          <p>

            This combination of phone-based data collection and web-based data management allows for efficient data
            handling and analysis while still leveraging the personal interaction of a phone interview.
